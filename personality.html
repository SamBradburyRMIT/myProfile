      <h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>I have completed 3 online personality related tests; Myers-Briggs, What Is My Learning Style and Test My Creativity.
		<br>It demonstrates that I am slightly more creative than what is average.  Learn new skills by doing tasks over theory. Also, that I am a positive person in general does tend to prefer to work on my own but is not an opposed to working with others.
		<br> I do not have the strongest leadership qualities; however, I am able to stand up and have my voice heard when required. 
		<br>I can visualize the bigger picture but not by stepping over others to achieve any goal. I am considerate to others and I can relate to others on a personal level.
		<br>When it comes to working in a group with designated tasks, I am more suitable to being involved with the more hands on and technical side. Less so the creative or documentative side. 
		<br>I am strong learning and adapting on the fly and less so making a strict plan or structure. I would benefit working with others that can adhere to a plan but are not necessarily bound by it. Having some flexibility to them.

		<h3>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</h3>

			<p class="col-sm-3">Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the Mediator personality type – but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with, the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.</p>
			<p class="col-sm-4">Few personality types are as poetic and kind-hearted as Mediators. Their altruism and vivid imagination allow Mediators to overcome many challenging obstacles, more often than not brightening the lives of those around them. Mediators’ creativity is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth. Yet Mediators can be easily tripped up in areas where their idealism and passion are more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is navigating interpersonal conflicts, confronting unpleasant facts, pursuing self-realization, or finding a career path that aligns well with your inner core, you may face numerous challenges that at times can even make you question who you really are. </p>
