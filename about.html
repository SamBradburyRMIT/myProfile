      <h3>What Am I After?</h3>
      <p>In an ideal scenario, I would like to run my own develpment company, building and maintaining websites and software. This is very idealistic and difficult to acheive, I will need much more knoledge and experiance to acheive this and this degree is my begining to this.</p><p>I have always worked in physical roles all my working life and as I start to get older my body is starting to let me down. I have always be a natual when it comes to technology with very little instruction and training. I have always found solutions and pathways where others would not. IT in general interests me a great deal and can see it being a great option for myself to support my family.</p>
	  <p>Avenues that I would need to take to reach my goals will include working in the industry. Jobs such as Front end developer or Database Administrator are the kinds of jobs that would put me in good stead to gain the knoledge of the industry</P>

    <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
