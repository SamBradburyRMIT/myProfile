			<p>Hi, my name is Sam Bradbury.</p>
			<p>I am currently completing my Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT via Open Universities Australia. </p>
			<p>I am working full time as a warehouse storeperson for PC Case Gear. Have interests in things such as working with computers (building and upgrading) PC games, tabletop wargames such as Warhammer 40k and also enjoy playing guitar.</P>
			<p><b>FUN FACT</b> I have 737 games in my steam library. about 500 of which I have not played and will probably never play.</p>

      <h3>What Am I After?</h3>
      <p>In an ideal scenario, I would like to run my own develpment company, building and maintaining websites and software. This is very idealistic and difficult to acheive, I will need much more knoledge and experiance to acheive this and this degree is my begining to this.</p><p>I have always worked in physical roles all my working life and as I start to get older my body is starting to let me down. I have always be a natual when it comes to technology with very little instruction and training. I have always found solutions and pathways where others would not. IT in general interests me a great deal and can see it being a great option for myself to support my family.</p>
	  <p>Avenues that I would need to take to reach my goals will include working in the industry. Jobs such as Front end developer or Database Administrator are the kinds of jobs that would put me in good stead to gain the knoledge of the industry</P>
	  <p>Started a degree years ago at a different uni that was a double degree in Game Design and Computer Science.
	  <br>Had to put that aside to go back to work full time. But I do have experiance now in some programming and coding theory.

      <h3>Recent Ideal Job Posting</h3>
		<p>This is an example of the type of work I would like to do within the industry.</p>
		<p>I have some experiance with varous programming languages, C C++ C# JAVA PYTHON HTML CSS PHP SQL. My previous experiances i found that I was quite good at learning new languages and enjoyed working with databases as well.

		<p>A full stack developer is someone that can develop for the entire system pipeline. Such as databases, servers, system engineering and the client side as well.</p>
		<p>To achieve a job like this, I will need a lot of industry experience, not just learn the languages. I will obviously learn a lot through the degree but work like this requires actual bodies of work as a developer.</p>
		<p>I chose a C# job as in my experience this is a very robust language that I grasped easily and loved using. It was my favourite of the languages that I had learnt.</p>
